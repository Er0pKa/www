            24-25-26-27-28? That's the kind of thing an idiot would have on his luggage!

            Security researchers have discovered a ludicrously simple way to hack into a number of Linux distributions: Just tap the backspace key 28 times in a row. A team from the Cybersecurity Group at Polytechnic University of Valencia (UPV) in Spain found that doing so for builds utilizing the ubiquitous Grub2 bootloader -- that's to say just about all of them -- immediately bypasses the lock screen, initiates the "Grub rescue shell" and grants the user access to the system for whatever nefarious things they have in mind.


        <p>
            The team found that the backspace trick triggers a memory error, which in turn launches the rescue shell. The bug isn't a huge threat -- I mean, a hacker would need physical access to your machine in order to exploit it -- especially now that Ubuntu, Red Hat, and Debian all have released patches.

            Or just enter the grub configuration screen and enter single user mode. Or boot with a pendrive. Or... if you have physical access, it's game over anyway.

            This will not work on a system that uses LUKS encryption at startup.

             This has nothing to do with Linux. grub2 will boot any number of different operating systems including Windows and BSD.
